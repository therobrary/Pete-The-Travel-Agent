**The Robrary: https://blog.robrary.com**

## Overview

This repository documents a fascinating experiment to test whether GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (GCCA) could successfully function as a GitHub Copilot Travel Agent (GCTA). The results were **remarkably promising**, with Copilot demonstrating impressive capabilities in comprehensive trip planning and travel logistics.

## Experiment Results

### What We Accomplished

GitHub Copilot successfully created detailed, professional-level travel planning documents including:

- **Comprehensive Trip Plans**: Complete 7-day itineraries with hour-by-hour scheduling
- **Budget Analysis**: Detailed cost breakdowns with per-person calculations and contingency planning
- **Accommodation Research**: In-depth Airbnb comparisons with pros/cons analysis and scoring systems
- **Route Planning**: GPS waypoints, driving directions, and emergency route alternatives
- **Activity Planning**: Both ski and non-ski activities with logistics coordination
- **Safety Documentation**: Emergency contacts, group coordination protocols, and contingency plans
- **Packing Lists**: Comprehensive, weather-appropriate gear lists for group travel
- **Logistical Details**: Everything from parking strategies to dietary considerations

### Quality Assessment

The generated content demonstrates:
- **Professional-level detail** comparable to travel agency planning
- **Practical considerations** often overlooked in manual planning
- **Comprehensive organization** with cross-referenced information
- **Real-world applicability** with actionable steps and contact information

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Review the Sample Trip**: Check out the [Stowe Ski Trip 2024-25 plan](trip-plans/stowe-ski-trip-2024-25.md) to see the level of detail achievable
2. **Use as Templates**: Copy and modify the planning documents for your own trips
3. **Create Trip Requests**: Use the GitHub issue template to request new trip plans
4. **Study the Process**: Examine how Copilot structures complex, multi-faceted planning tasks

## Important Configuration: Firewall Settings

**⚠️ Critical Setup Requirement**

For GitHub Copilot Coding Agent to effectively research activities, lodging, and travel information, you need to **configure your firewall settings** to allow the Coding Agent to access the internet for web searches. This enables the AI to access current pricing, availability, and real-world travel data.

### How to Configure Firewall Settings

Refer to the official GitHub documentation for detailed instructions specific to the Copilot Coding Agent:

- **Copilot Coding Agent Firewall Configuration**: [Customizing or disabling the firewall for Copilot Coding Agent](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/agents/copilot-coding-agent/customizing-or-disabling-the-firewall-for-copilot-coding-agent)
- **General Copilot Network Configuration**: [Configuring your proxy server or firewall for GitHub Copilot](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-your-proxy-server-or-firewall-for-github-copilot)
- **Copilot Enterprise Settings**: [Managing GitHub Copilot features in your organization](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-github-copilot-features-in-your-organization)

### Required Network Access

Ensure your network allows access to:
- `*.github.com`
- `*.githubcopilot.com` 
- `*.openai.com`
- External websites for travel research and data gathering
- Search engines and travel-related APIs

## Key Findings

### Strengths Demonstrated
- **Exceptional attention to detail** in planning logistics
- **Comprehensive risk assessment** and contingency planning
- **Practical, actionable information** rather than generic advice
- **Professional formatting** and organization
- **Integration of multiple data sources** into cohesive plans

### Experiment Conclusion

The GitHub Copilot Coding Agent (GCCA) → GitHub Copilot Travel Agent (GCTA) experiment was **highly successful**. Copilot demonstrated remarkable capability in:
- Complex multi-variable planning
- Research and data synthesis
- Risk assessment and contingency planning  
- Professional documentation creation
- Practical, real-world application focus

This suggests strong potential for AI-assisted travel planning and demonstrates Copilot's versatility beyond traditional coding tasks.
