## Packing Tips and Strategies

### Efficient Packing
**Layer clothing**: Roll clothes instead of folding to save space  
**Use packing cubes**: Organize by type (base layers, outer wear, etc.)  
**Wear heaviest items**: Wear boots and heavy jacket while traveling  
**Share items**: Coordinate with group to avoid duplicate toiletries  

### Weight and Space Management
**Limit to one large bag + carry-on**: Easier for accommodation transfers  
**Pack essentials in carry-on**: In case checked luggage is delayed  
**Leave room for souvenirs**: Don't pack to maximum capacity  
**Heavy items in car**: Take advantage of road trip storage space  

### Organization Systems
**Daily outfit planning**: Plan outfits for each day to avoid overpacking  
**Dirty clothes strategy**: Bring laundry bag and plan mid-trip laundry  
**Access prioritization**: Keep frequently used items easily accessible  
**Emergency kit**: Pack one day's essentials in easy-to-reach location

## Special Considerations

**Extremity protection**: Extra attention to hands, feet, face protection  
**Moisture management**: Avoid cotton, choose synthetic or wool materials

### High-Activity Packing

**Equipment durability**: Check zippers, seams, waterproofing before trip  
**Recovery items**: Epsom salts for baths, pain relief medication  
**Energy maintenance**: High-energy snacks, electrolyte supplements  

### Group Travel Considerations
